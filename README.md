# **The Knickerbocker Case**
A lot of things inspired me to create a dark, twisted tale such as this. I'm fascinated by haunted locations and the noir era of the late 1940s. 
The primary location for this narrative is The Knickerbocker Hotel, which was built in the 1920s and operated as a popular hotel joint until the
1970s where it was renovated into a retirement home. The place is believed to be haunted after a 1936 seance held by Houdini's wife went awry and unleased a
malevolent spirit. For more interesting history on The Knickerbocker, see:

- [Hotel Knickerbocker Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knickerbocker_Hotel_(Los_Angeles))

The Knickerbocker is also a location that is very close to home because my grandmother resided there for a span of four years before changing locations.
I know the place all too well and it always gave me this eerie vibe that sent constant chills down my spine. There was always a weird energy around
the place. The decorum was kept very dated and it just seemed like a haunted place to me as a child, so I wanted to set a dark noir thriller exploring
the location and that played off of its unique history. 

Another important matter to consider in this game is that the crime is not solved for you. I did not mean to write this as a game in which the
ending writes itself because the sheer evidence is unexplainable. I, on purpose, wanted to put a mark on my readers and players and leave them questioning
what exactly took place in the hotel. I leave it to the players to interpret the evidence anyway they choose. This aspect was largely inspired by 
*The Colorado Kid*, a Hard Case Crime book written by my favorite author, Stephen King.

### Procedural Text Application
**A cool feature of this game lies within the first page. If you continuously click "file reports", something interesting happens!** This works mostly due in part
to the procedural text in my code. Go ahead, and play around with it prior to progressing further along in the story.
