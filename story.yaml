            The year is 1948...
            <br/><br/>
            And it's business as usual for a veteran homicide detective in crime-ridden Los Angeles. Your desk is flooded with criminal 
            reports, the files all loosely scattered around the desk's metallic surface area. The phones have also been peevishly feverish all day.
            The constant ringing often brings back the dreary toils of war.
            <br/><br/>
            At 2 A.M. Pacific Time, you recieve a phone call from a resident of the Knickerbocker Hotel located in Hollywoodland, 
            California. The voice is hoarse and quite raspy, but you can make out that it's a male on the other end
            of the line. He's informed you that a young woman has been murdered in the vicinity of the hotel. 
            <br/><br/>
            Just when you thought you could finally dispose of your fedora and call it a night.

          - A good detective needs to have an organized desk. It's important that you clean up your desk and put
            away all files in their proper folders. The investigation can be put on hold for now. 
          
          - "You've spent enough time filing your reports. Your desk is now nice and organized. All of the files have been cleared off. Perhaps, it's time to get on with the investigation."

      You are standing timidly outside the towering Knickerbocker Hotel, your hands trembling as you shakenly attempt to light 
      a cigarette. The tremors in your hand refuse to subside ever since the war. A cold breeze stiffens your neck. Your anxiety is 
      imminently curbed by the sweet feel of the cigarette in between your lips.

             The lobby reeks heavy of tobacco and putrescent mold. The furniture is riddled with wine stains amongst other fluids. So much

                The bartender pours you a shot of Jack Daniel's and introduces himself as caretaker Daniel O'Banion. He gives off an eerie vibe.
                The counter vibrates with each word, causing certain objects to shake. It feels as though he's tethered to the hotel. Quite ominous.

                <br/><br/>
                Mr. O'Banion doesn't recall any phone call being made. However, he points you to the elevators and tells

               The moment you step inside the elevator, the doors seal shut and you are lifted up to the
               tenth floor. As if possessed, the elevator itself pressed the floor button for you and pointed
               you in the right direction. You tightly grasp onto the handlebar as the elevator pulls you
               ten stories high.

                of forced entry. You shift your gaze downwards towards the body.

                As you closely examnine the body, there are no ligature marks that you can see.
                There also doesn't appear to be any stab wounds anywhere remotely on her body. You tilt 
                her head to the side and notice a branding mark scorched into her skin. You make it
                out to be the symbol of a local Irish mob. That tells you she was mob property.
                <br/><br/>
                You think you've seen enough, but something you notice stops you. There was a slight jitter in her mouth. 
                There's no way she can possibly be alive due to the rigor mortis that's already eaten up much of her body. You
                slip on some latex gloves and gently pull her chin down to unveil the inside of her mouth. As your are about to peer in
                with the light of your flashlight, a mangy rat crawls out of her mouth and quickly scatters away. You can see that her tongue 
                has been removed. The first thought that comes to mind is the mob was involved. That's just what they do to people who
                say something they should've kept to themselves. 
                <br/><br/>
                If the evidence has made itself clear to you, feel free to leave and piece it all together at your desk. If you further feel the 
                need to explore, go with your gut instinct.

                Reaching your hand gently into the hole, you uncover what appears to be a dusty old manuscript page.
                The page is written in Latin and describes various incantations. And the bottom corner of the page is smudged
                with blood. A strange item to have hidden in the walls.

                the pile, but fail to recover her identification card. You instead find some crumpled documents

                You don't want to spend anymore time in that grim hotel than you need to. You take the elevator back down to the

          - Given the demonic incantation page that you discovered in the bathroom along with the bloody pentagram on the bathroom mirror,
            you believe witchcraft was involved. Your theory is that Alina was human trafficked from Romania and sold into prostitution
            for the Irish mob. They soon found out that she was practicing witchcraft in her room and grew worried that she may plant a 
            curse on them as revenge for their sins. They killed her and removed her tongue after the fact to make it look like she was 
            a snitch to ward off any suspicions from the capos and the boss. That's all she wrote. 
            
          - You believe what transpired at the hotel was a "Rosemary's Baby" type of situation. All of the residents of the hotel in adjacent rooms
            and on neighboring floors were part of a cult that uses witchcraft to summon their demonic entity known as the "Knicker." Alina was an easy target for
            them to be used as part of their sacrifice, for she was stolen from her homeland; no family, no one to come looking for her. They needed some sort of
            organ from her in order for the sacrifice to proceed. And that would explain her missing tongue. This sends shivers down your spine. 
          
          - Maybe Alina found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time and heard something she wasn't supposed to hear.
            The mobsters shortly found her eavesdropping and decided to cut out her tongue so she wouldn't talk. Perhaps, she could
            still implicate someone by pointing them out of a lineup, so they proceeded to kill her and make it look as though she was a witch, given
            her Romanian origins. Goddamn bastards.
